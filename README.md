## What's here?

### Helical antenna designs

* `Helical/UHC lhcp-version_1` is version 1 of our Helical antenna design.  It's
  a left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP) antenna, and requires only
  3D-printed parts (no CNC milling or laser-cutting required).

* `Helical/UHF-434-8-version_4` is version 4 of our Helical antenna design, an
  8-turn Helix that can be made in either left- or right-hand
  circularly polarized (RHCP) configurations.  It requires a laser cutter or
  water jet cutter for the plexiglass/polycarbonate supports, but is
  more rigid than version 1.

* `Helical/UHF-435-8-version_5` is version 5 of the Helical antenna
  design; it comes in RHCP configuration.  The supports are made from
  aluminum, and will require a drill press.
